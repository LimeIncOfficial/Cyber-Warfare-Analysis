# Cyber-Warfare-Analysis
Credit to alienvault and countless other threat exchange platforms for keeping me informed.

This will be an ongoing series of projects (hopefully) that will give us a better insight on modern cyberwarfare and how it differs to traditional APT operations and malware campaigns against corparations and the general public. 

The contents of each project will include: replica malware along with the steps taken to configure, modify, and construct all pieces of software; Sandbox and RE analysis of replica software compared to actual samples; A writeup on TTPs observed in the sample and how we replicated them in ours as well as an overview on the usefullness of the TTPs and their methadology.
